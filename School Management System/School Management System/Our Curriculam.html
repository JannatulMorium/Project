                       AMSC is one of the largest private English-medium schools in Bangladesh, offering pre-school to A' Level classes of an international standard. It offers a complete school-leaving course using English as the medium of instruction. We emphasize equal proficiency in Bangla as a necessary prerequisite for a well-rounded education for Bangladeshi students.</p>
                        <p>AMSC's curriculum has been designed to reflect the specific needs of Bangladeshi students keeping in mind their heritage, culture and national identity. </p>
                        <p>The school has designed a comprehensive curriculum for all classes leading to the University of Cambridge 
International Examinations Ordinary and Advanced Level General Certificate of Education courses which are 
taught in Classes IX to XII. These examinations are administered by the British Council, Dhaka. </p>

                       ASMC provides a complete school-leaving course of study, from pre-school to the A' Levels. We have developed our own curriculum; it aims to deliver a holistic education program combining the core competencies of the national and the British curricula. The comprehensive curriculum designed for the elementary, secondary and high school classes ultimately leads to the University of Cambridge International Examinations Ordinary and Advanced Level General Certificate of Education exams, taught in the high school. These examinations are conducted under the auspices of the British Council, Dhaka.</p>

                       Scholastica's O' Level program encourages students to engage, invent, manage and compete - equipping them for eventual success in the public examinations under Cambridge International Examinations.

Class IX is very important because this is when students begin to prepare for the public examination that will take them to the next stage of their academic career. Students typically choose 8 subjects at this level. The syllabus is chalked out in such a way that the bulk of the work is covered in Class IX. We offer several science, humanities and commerce subjects, and students are also encouraged to take co-curricular subjects such as media studies, physical education, music or drama. Maths, English and Bangla remain core subjects that are mandatory for all students. In Class X, students focus on revision work followed by two mock exams which are held in March or April of each year.

Subjects offered in the O’ Level include Additional Maths, History, Geography, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Business Studies, Environmental Management, Economics, Principles of Accounts, Bangladesh Studies, Computer Science, and Art & Design. From the 2016-17 session, we will also offer Enterprise and Combined Science.

The teaching program at Scholastica is a complete one; we cover the O' Level syllabus thoroughly and undertake overall revision effectively. Regular written work is done throughout the course either at home or under supervision in class to reinforce learning and to give the students the maximum amount of practice in taking exams. Of course, feedback on assessment is an integral part of the learning process.

The school is very strict about attesting students' admission forms for the public examination. It will only do so for the examinations according to the prescribed schedule; therefore, students who take advance exams or additional subjects may not be able to avail the facility of sitting for the exams in our own premises and the school will not take the responsibility of completing the syllabus or the teaching program for such subjects.

                       The A' Level Program provides a demanding, expansive educational experience to a select group of diverse, talented and intellectually sophisticated students. Through this program we aim to prepare our students for entry to the great universities of the world! Our excellent and experienced A' Level faculty ensure that our students are given the best guidance for success at the A' Level examinations.

The total course for the A' Level runs over a period of two academic years. The Class X students who have graduated from Scholastica may apply for admission in the A' Level course. Each student is admitted on a provisional basis, subject to their successful completion of the O' Level to the satisfaction of the school. At this level, students typically take 3 or 4 subjects.

We offer several science and commerce based subjects, and students are also encouraged to take co-curricular subjects such as media studies, physical education, music or drama. There are no mandatory subjects at this level of specialization. Subjects offered at the A’ Level include Economics, Physics, Chemistry, Business, Biology, Accounting, Computer Science, Mathematics, and from the 2016-17 session, we will also offer Law, Psychology and English.

The structure of the A' Level program is such that students take one set of exams at the end of Class XI (the Advanced Subsidiary - 'AS') and their final public examinations at the end of Class XII (typically referred to as the 'A2').

                       The academic year begins in July and ends in June. Classes commence in August or September after the Orientation Week is completed.

The school year is divided into four quarters, i.e. two terms. The First Term begins in August (after the summer vacation) and the Second Term begins in January (after the winter vacation).Winter Break, Spring Break, Summer Break and the two Eid breaks are the mainscheduled vacations during the academic year.



The dates of all the school vacations and other important dates are given in the Annual School Calendar, which is included in every student's School Diary. In addition, parents can download the calendar from the downloads section of our website. Click here to access those documents.

                      Every child needs 21st century knowledge and skills to succeed as productive citizens and leaders in their future. At Scholastica, we believe in the use of modern best practices in teaching that will give students the skills to think critically, solve problems collaboratively and work independently. We believe that the skills that students need to succeed include the development of local and global awareness, and personal and social responsibility. To achieve these goals, Scholastica has created a unique curriculum and works closely with faculty, management and the Curriculum Development Unit to implement modern, international practices in education.

We believe in teaching that:

Is learner-centric
Is thought-provoking
Takes into account the needs of individuals
Prepares students for the real world
We avoid teaching that is:

Focused on rote learning and memorization
Overly concerned with exams rather than real-world skills
Generic and non-specific to individual needs
At Scholastica, we want to develop students who are:

Independent learners: we don't tell them everything, we encourage them to learn for themselves.
Curious: we encourage them to ask questions and challenge us and each other.
Critical thinkers: we ensure students understand what they are learning, rather than just memorizing what the teacher has said.
Willing to take challenges: we push students to think at higher levels and apply their skills, rather than being intimidated by new types of questions or tasks.
Creative: we encourage students to apply imagination and think outside-the-box, and we reward students who go beyond the book or what they have been taught.
Collaborative: we encourage students to work with peers to teach each other and solve problems together.
