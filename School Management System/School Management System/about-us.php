                      In the sun-scorched summer of 1977, an ambitious and determined woman negotiated to rent a two-storied building for a school, just off the main road near Dhanmondi Lake. Mrs. Yasmeen Murshed wanted to call the school "Scholastica", a purposeful response to the need for an organized school-leaving course in Bangladesh using English as the medium of instruction.

Mrs. Murshed began her career in education as a teacher in various institutions and after the Liberation war she began teaching small groups of students at home, which led to the establishment of 'Scholastica Tutorial' in 1977. The school slowly grew and developed under her leadership and now, called 'Scholastica', it is situated in several locations in the city, including Dhanmondi, Mirpur, Gulshan and Uttara.

The school is currently managed by her daughter, Syeda Madiha Murshed, and Mrs. Murshed remains on the board of management. Madiha is the Managing Director and is responsible for overall operations and development of the school.

Over the years, the school has changed and developed significantly, and yet it has retained its essential characteristics-striving for the highest standards in education, while emphasizing whole child development through sports, events, the arts and all kinds of other extra-curricular. Scholastica continues to be one of the largest and most highly-regarded private schools in Bangladesh.

                      We are proud of our two custom-built campuses in Uttara and Mirpur. These facilities allow us to provide safe and comfortable environments for learning, as well as state-of-the-art infrastructure that rivals schools at a global level.

Each of the custom-built campuses has been carefully designed and provides numerous facilities for our faculty and students, including:

Spacious and comfortable, air-conditioned classrooms
High school classrooms which are equipped with smartboards and projectors
An indoor multipurpose hall, used for events, performances and sports
Outdoor hard-courts that host sports tournaments throughout the year
Fully equipped labs for biology, chemistry, physics and computer studies
Library and teacher's resource center
Cafeteria and fully-operational canteen services
Fully stocked bookshop and fee collection booth
Our campus in Mirpur, more recently built, also houses a swimming pool.

Together with these two custom-built campuses we have four more campuses in Dhanmondi, Gulshan and Uttara, which are rented. In order to ensure safe and comfortable environments for learning we have renovated these rented premises and customized them to maximize the school's facilities.

All our classrooms are air-conditioned, and we have designed them to provide comfortable, safe and positive learning environments for our students.

                      In Scholastica, we implement modern, international best practices in education. We believe in teaching that...

is student-focused,
is thought-provoking and creative
takes into account the needs of individuals and
prepares students for the real world.
We teach our students to be...

independent learners:  we don't tell them everything, we encourage them to learn for themselves
curious:  we encourage them to ask questions and challenge us and each other
critical thinkers:  we ensure students understand what they are learning, rather than just memorizing what they read or hear
willing to take challenges:  we push students to think at higher levels and apply their skills, rather than being intimidated by new types of questions or tasks
creative:  : we encourage students to apply imagination and think outside-the-box, and we reward students who go beyond the book or what they have been taught.
All subjects are taught using interactive and activity-based methods. Asking questions is always encouraged and students are given opportunities to share their own opinion and think critically about the issues at hand. Important skills are also developed through the academic program, so that students are able to keep on learning even after they graduate.
