Scholastica is committed to whole child development. If we are to prepare students for life, and for success in the modern day, then we must develop positive character attributes, skills and attitudes that go beyond academics. We provide opportunities for whole child development by emphasizing extracurricular activities and physical activities, events and functions of all kinds, a range of leadership opportunities, numerous after-school programs and character building activities during the school day too.</p>

<p>We also believe parents are an integral part of the school community. Parents are welcome to meet teachers and management by making appointments. We also invite parents to attend various school events and in junior classes, parents are invited to observe classes. Parents are encouraged to volunteer and get involved in the school community in others ways. We ask parents to share their ideas, suggestions, problems and concerns through email, in person or during numerous meetings held with parents throughout the year.

We try to make life in Scholastica fun, educational and productive for students, while developing their skills beyond academics. We do this in numerous ways-community service projects, science fairs, leadership opportunities, international trips and sports competitions. Additional programs for older students, such as Boy Scouts and the Duke of Edinburgh Award program, encourage our students to broaden their horizons and build leadership skills.

The school holds a number of events and functions throughout the school year. These are an important part of our programs, contributing to our educational mission. Some of the events include:


Events to commemorate Pahela Baishakh, International Mother Language Day and Shaheed Dibash, Eid-e-Miladun-Nabi, Independence Day, and Victory Day, as well as other national and international events. Various events, such as competitions, shows, functions, recitals and displays are held in all the sections.
Orientation Week is an orientation program for students and parents which are held on each campus before the commencement of the new academic session.
Sports events are also held every year to encourage students to participate in physical activities. There are inter-class competitions, matches between schools and inter-school championships that form a part of our sports program. The sports teams in the Middle and Senior School have been successful in a number of national and international sporting events.
Annual plays, and other functions that commemorate international days of significance are also held.
The Annual Class Party allows students to spend their last day of the Term in school with fun and merriment (and an absence of academic work) but within the framework of propriety and discipline.

oing beyond borders is one of Scholastica's traditions and is an integral part of holistic education. We believe it is very important to organize field trips and other kinds of trips that expose our students to different challenges, multiple perspectives and other cultures or lifestyles. Scholastica was one of the first private schools in Bangladesh to organize foreign trips for its students, starting with a trip to India for the cricket team about 20 years ago! Since then, Scholastica's students have gone on school trips to compete in sports tournaments, leadership programs and cultural exchanges. Such trips help to develop student's confidence, public speaking skills, leadership and competitiveness and expose students to the larger global community and enhance the reputation of Scholastica abroad. We are proud of the range of trips we arrange every year.

This lists the highlights of the school-arranged trips that our students took in the last few years. We would like to thank all the parents, teachers and management who support our young adventurers as they spread their wings and explore all the corners of our country and the globe!

All of Scholastica's campuses have outdoor space for sports. In the Senior Section Uttara and Mirpur campuses, there are outdoor hard courts on which students can play basketball, volleyball, handball and football. The two STM Halls in the two campuses are also used for sports during PE class and after-school.

The Mirpur campus has an outdoor swimming pool which is available to older students from any campus to learn how to swim (as a beginner) and to practice swimming as well. Students are taught various strokes and are given opportunities to improve their fitness. A qualified swimming instructor is in charge of conducting all swimming classes.

In addition, students in some campuses are able to access a nearby field for their physical education activities.

Scholastica has two multipurpose halls located in the Senior Section Uttara and Mirpur campuses. With a spacious lobby and full air-conditioning, these halls cater to the various requirements of the school for holding exams, events, sports and theatrical productions.

Scholastica is the first private English-medium school in Bangladesh to provide facilities for the British Council, Dhaka to hold the CIE O' and A' Level examinations in its own premises. The examinations are held in STM Hall of the Senior Campus in Uttara and Mirpur in May and June every year. All arrangements are made by the British Council to ensure proper invigilation, monitoring and supervision; our students are able to take this important test in the safe and secure surroundings of their own campus.

We believe that parents' involvement in the school is an integral component in a child's success in school, and can make a significant contribution to the development and learning process of the students. Parents are welcome to make appointments to visit the school and meet with teachers or management personnel to discuss any aspect of their child's education. We also regularly survey parents on important issues to get their feedback on opinions on new initiatives or current services.

In order to ensure parents are aware of the updates and news from campus, and are receiving important information about their child's progress, we have several services in place to communicate efficiently and smoothly with parents.
