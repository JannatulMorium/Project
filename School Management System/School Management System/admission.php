Nursery to IX Admissions:  From January onwards application forms are collected for the next academic session which starts in July. The Admission Test starts in spring.

                      Who We Serve

We serve Bangladeshi families who value a good education. We welcome those who appreciate well-rounded educational opportunities that go beyond just academics. The members of our community place importance on good character, moral and social development as well as excellent academics.

Admission is offered those who want to receive a balanced and well-rounded education using English as the primary medium of instruction but placing equal emphasis on Bangla.

It is compulsory for all students to take Bangla up to O' Level. Students who have lived abroad and do not have a good foundation in Bangla can take "Special Bangla" in small groups which is an accelerated program designed to help those students come up to the required level.

Eligibility for Admission

The admission procedure starts as follows:

Playgroup: Starts in September for the next academic session.
Nursery - Class X: Starts in January for the next academic session.
A' Level: Starts in June for the next academic session.
For the A' Level, admission is only offered if students meet minimum academic requirements. Seats are very limited so students are advised to apply early.

We take students into Playgroup at age 3+, so parents are advised to apply when the child is 2+ years old.

Completing the Admission Form

We require several documents to be attached to the Admission Form, and a checklist is provided on the form itself. Please note that the following vaccination and immunization records should be provided with the Admission Form:

1.	Polio 
2.	Diphtheria/ Pertussis/ Tetanus (DPT)
3.	Mumps / Measles / Rubella (MMR)
4.	Chicken Pox
5.	Haemophilus Influenza Type B (Hib)
6.	Hepatitis A and B
These documents help us to process the application efficiently. We request parents to fill up the form and attach all documents carefully to ensure all the data provided is correct, true and accurate. Please check the forms and documents very carefully to ensure there are no mistakes; if mistakes or discrepancies in the admission form are found later, this can lead to all kinds of problems after the child has been admitted.

                     Financial Assistance

The Management of Scholastica is committed to provide access to top quality education for the wider community. Through the Scholastica Scholarship Program we have developed support for both underprivileged and meritorious students. The Scholarship Program has two components, as follows:

Merit based Scholarship

Need based Financial Assistance

Merit based Scholarship

As a part of our recognition of hard work, dedication and academic excellence, Scholastica offers Merit Scholarships to one student each from Class V to X. To become eligible for a Merit Scholarship, students must demonstrate excellent academic records. Top students are then invited to sit for the Merit Exam, and the highest achievers are invited for interviews. Through this process, one student is selected to receive the Merit Scholarship from each class.

Need based Financial Assistance

Every year Scholastica provides a large amount of financial assistance to our students. We feel proud that we can assist our students to ensure that their education is not interrupted due to external circumstances outside their control. We look forward to continuing such support for our students for years to come. For further information, parents may email directly to school management.

Scholastica charges a single annual tuition fee. There is no separately yearly charge. At the time of admission, we charge an Admission Fee as well.

Scholastica offers flexibility for parents in both the payment structure and payment mode for its annual tuition fees. In addition, stationery and textbooks can be purchased through the school for an additional fee, which varies from class to class (this is not mandatory but is designed as a convenience for parents).

For more information about our fees, payment structures and payment modes, please contact our Admissions Office, based in the Mirpur campus at 01817031818.

Admission Fee

The Admission Fee is divided in two parts i.e. actual Admission fee and Security deposit fee.

The Admission Fee is non-refundable. However, after a student leaves the school, the security deposit is refundable if the conditions for a refund are met. Details are provided to parents in the Student-Parent Handbook.
