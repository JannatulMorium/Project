                            AMSC is one of the largest private English-medium schools in Bangladesh, offering pre-school to A' Level classes of an international standard.

                            ASMC provides a complete school-leaving course of study, from pre-school to the A' Levels. We have developed our own curriculum; it aims to deliver a holistic education program combining the core competencies of the national and the British curricula. The comprehensive curriculum designed for the elementary, secondary and high school classes ultimately leads to the University of Cambridge International Examinations Ordinary and Advanced Level General Certificate of Education exams, taught in the high school. These examinations are conducted under the auspices of the British Council, Dhaka.</p>

                    <p><img src="img/Olevel.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="about image">
                        Scholastica's O' Level program encourages students to engage, invent, manage and compete - equipping them for eventual success in the public examinations under Cambridge International Examinations.

                        Class IX is very important because this is when students begin to prepare for the public examination that will take them to the next stage of their academic career. Students typically choose 8 subjects at this level. The syllabus is chalked out in such a way that the bulk of the work is covered in Class IX. We offer several science, humanities and commerce subjects, and students are also encouraged to take co-curricular subjects such as media studies, physical education, music or drama. Maths, English and Bangla remain core subjects that are mandatory for all students. In Class X, students focus on revision work followed by two mock exams which are held in March or April of each year.

                        Subjects offered in the Oâ€™ Level include Additional Maths, History, Geography, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Business Studies, Environmental Management, Economics, Principles of Accounts, Bangladesh Studies, Computer Science, and Art & Design. From the 2016-17 session, we will also offer Enterprise and Combined Science.

                        The teaching program at Scholastica is a complete one; we cover the O' Level syllabus thoroughly and undertake overall revision effectively. Regular written work is done throughout the course either at home or under supervision in class to reinforce learning and to give the students the maximum amount of practice in taking exams. Of course, feedback on assessment is an integral part of the learning process.

                        The school is very strict about attesting students' admission forms for the public examination. It will only do so for the examinations according to the prescribed schedule; therefore, students who take advance exams or additional subjects may not be able to avail the facility of sitting for the exams in our own premises and the school will not take the responsibility of completing the syllabus or the teaching program for such subjects.

                        The A' Level Program provides a demanding, expansive educational experience to a select group of diverse, talented and intellectually sophisticated students. Through this program we aim to prepare our students for entry to the great universities of the world! Our excellent and experienced A' Level faculty ensure that our students are given the best guidance for success at the A' Level examinations.

                        The total course for the A' Level runs over a period of two academic years. The Class X students who have graduated from Scholastica may apply for admission in the A' Level course. Each student is admitted on a provisional basis, subject to their successful completion of the O' Level to the satisfaction of the school. At this level, students typically take 3 or 4 subjects.

                        We offer several science and commerce based subjects, and students are also encouraged to take co-curricular subjects such as media studies, physical education, music or drama. There are no mandatory subjects at this level of specialization. Subjects offered at the Aâ€™ Level include Economics, Physics, Chemistry, Business, Biology, Accounting, Computer Science, Mathematics, and from the 2016-17 session, we will also offer Law, Psychology and English.

                        The structure of the A' Level program is such that students take one set of exams at the end of Class XI (the Advanced Subsidiary - 'AS') and their final public examinations at the end of Class XII (typically referred to as the 'A2').

                        The academic year begins in July and ends in June. Classes commence in August or September after the Orientation Week is completed.

                        The school year is divided into four quarters, i.e. two terms. The First Term begins in August (after the summer vacation) and the Second Term begins in January (after the winter vacation).Winter Break, Spring Break, Summer Break and the two Eid breaks are the mainscheduled vacations during the academic year.



                        The dates of all the school vacations and other important dates are given in the Annual School Calendar, which is included in every student's School Diary. In addition, parents can download the calendar from the downloads section of our website. Click here to access those documents.

                    <p><img src="img/21stCentury.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="about image">
                        Every child needs 21st century knowledge and skills to succeed as productive citizens and leaders in their future. At Scholastica, we believe in the use of modern best practices in teaching that will give students the skills to think critically, solve problems collaboratively and work independently. We believe that the skills that students need to succeed include the development of local and global awareness, and personal and social responsibility. To achieve these goals, Scholastica has created a unique curriculum and works closely with faculty, management and the Curriculum Development Unit to implement modern, international practices in education.

                        We believe in teaching that:

                        Is learner-centric
                        Is thought-provoking
                        Takes into account the needs of individuals
                        Prepares students for the real world
                        We avoid teaching that is:

                        Focused on rote learning and memorization
                        Overly concerned with exams rather than real-world skills
                        Generic and non-specific to individual needs
                        At Scholastica, we want to develop students who are:

                        Independent learners: we don't tell them everything, we encourage them to learn for themselves.
                        Curious: we encourage them to ask questions and challenge us and each other.
                        Critical thinkers: we ensure students understand what they are learning, rather than just memorizing what the teacher has said.
                        Willing to take challenges: we push students to think at higher levels and apply their skills, rather than being intimidated by new types of questions or tasks.
                        Creative: we encourage students to apply imagination and think outside-the-box, and we reward students who go beyond the book or what they have been taught.
                        Collaborative: we encourage students to work with peers to teach each other and solve problems together.

                        Curriculum Development Unit

                        Scholastica's Curriculum Development Unit (CDU) is an independent department that oversees the academic program. The unit ensures that a high standard of education is delivered uniformly at all levels of the school and ensures best practices in teaching. It monitors the delivery of the academic program and comes up with effective services and strategies for imparting our curriculum and maintaining consistency. The unit also oversees the planning of the annual syllabus based on the custom-designed curriculum of the school.

                        The unit also works on quality control and the development of curriculum and teaching resources. Developing textbooks and workbooks is a key component of this unit's work. These books are used in Scholastica and in numerous schools throughout the country.

                        CDU plays an important role in faculty supervision and training. The unit researches and develops the academic curriculum and teaching resources to suit modern teaching and learning needs and promotes a progressive and dynamic approach to education.

                        Special Education Program

                        All children should be entitled to a broad, balanced and purposeful curriculum and Scholastica is committed to ensuring all students can achieve at their highest potential. Some children have varying needs that may require them to be given extra attention in order to keep up with the standard set by the school. Scholastica has developed, therefore, a Special Education Program, which is a set of policies and planned activities, based on global best principles and practices, to cater to the special educational needs of students in Scholastica. In many cases, these students are asked to attend specialized classes (called "Skills Labs"), which are small and allow very close teacher-student interaction. In this way, students who are below the standard of the class are given special attention to build their skills and achieve academic success up to their full potential.

                        Faculty

                        Scholasticaâ€™s teachers are some of the busiest educational professionals in the country! We are committed to excellence and work hard to deliver our best to our students. High standards are maintained through intensive and comprehensive training programs. Close monitoring and supervision is provided to help teachers implement modern teaching methods.

                        Qualifications

                        We are proud of our faculty, who work hard to challenge, teach and inspire our students. Our teachers are typically graduate or post-graduate degree holders in their respective subjects from well-reputed institutions. A number of our teachers have an educational background in teaching with degrees such as M.Ed or B.Ed.

                        Training

                        Teaching and learning go hand in hand. Faculty training and development has been a high priority for us. Scholastica is the first school that has undertaken an initiative to certify all teachers. We have engaged a professional training organization, SPEED, to conduct formal teacher training courses for our facultyâ€”a one-year teaching skills course offered by Cambridge International Examinations.

                        Our high school teachers also regularly participate in workshops provided by Cambridge International Examinations on O and A level subjects. And SPEED offers General English, Speaking and Pronunciation courses and IT workshops for teachers to help them to upgrade their professional and communication skills.

                        In-service training for teachers is a very important function of our management personnel. Since the school uses a curriculum that has been carefully tailored to its vision and needs, specialized training is necessary to ensure proper implementation of the curriculum. Under the supervision of the senior management personnel, for each stage of education, in-depth and extensive training is provided to all members of faculty according to their needs.
